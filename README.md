# itsojaylicious

A terminal-based personal portfolio published as an npm package.

## Overview

itsojaylicious is a CLI portfolio that allows anyone to view my personal profile directly from the terminal.  
Instead of visiting a traditional portfolio website, this package presents my information in a clean and interactive command-line interface.

The goal of this project is to showcase creativity, technical skills, and personality in a format that developers and recruiters are already comfortable with — the terminal.

## Usage

You can run the portfolio instantly without installing anything globally:

npx itsojaylicious

Alternatively, install the package locally:

npm install itsojaylicious

After installation, execute it from your project environment.
